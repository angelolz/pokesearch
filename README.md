# Pokésearch
This project is a website that allows you to look up information about Pokémon, their moves, and the different items. I made this website for my CS401 Intro to Web Development class. This was a way for me to showcase all the skills I've learned throughout the course, where I implemented **HTML, CSS, JS, SQL and PHP** in this website. I wanted to do something that was API driven, since I've had some experience dealing with API's before with my [Animal Crossing Discord Bot](https://top.gg/bot/701038771776520222).

A live webpage for this project is available [here](https://www.pokesearch.org/)!

    I'm especially proud of this one as I've been able to get fuzzy searching working. Also, if you entered the name of the Pokémon, move, or item exactly, it will take you directly to the page!

- **Pokémon team management!**

    This feature was a bit finnicky to work with, as it was the first time I used JS and having to implement AJAX as well. But it works mostly fine! Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to fix the styling for the team management page. :(

The people at the PokéAPI slack workspace helped me out when I was having troubles, and KLogger helped me fixed issues I was struggling with when I was trying to debug my PHP code :')
